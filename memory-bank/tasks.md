# Project Tasks

## Task: Tiered Loyalty Program Implementation

### Description
Implement a tiered loyalty program for liquidity providers using Curve and Uniswap V3 pools on the Arbitrum network. The system fetches and processes liquidity events, calculates rewards based on token prices, and logs the data locally while providing API access to the calculated data.
