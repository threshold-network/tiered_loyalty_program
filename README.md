# Tiered Loyalty Program

This project implements a tiered loyalty program for liquidity providers using Curve and Uniswap V3 pools on the Arbitrum network. The system fetches and processes liquidity events, calculates rewards based on token prices, and provides API access to the calculated data.

## Project Status: COMPLETED âœ…
This project has been successfully completed and archived. All core features have been implemented, and the system is fully operational. The most recent update ensures rewards are calculated consistently using the program end date.

## Overview
The tiered loyalty program rewards liquidity providers based on their time-weighted average liquidity. The system fetches events from Curve and Uniswap V3 pools, calculates the total value of tokens involved, and distributes rewards proportionally. Rewards calculation respects the program's start and end dates for consistency. The backend runs an asynchronous loop for data processing and serves results via a Flask API.

## Setup
1. **Set up a virtual environment:**
   ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Create required directories:**
   The application requires `logs` and `data/balances` directories.
   ```sh
    mkdir -p logs data/balances
    ```

4. **Configure environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables. Get API keys and RPC URLs from the respective services.
   ```dotenv
   # Required
   ALCHEMY_URL=your_arbitrum_alchemy_https_url # Recommended RPC endpoint
   COINGECKO_API_KEY=your_coingecko_api_key # Optional for CoinGecko API
   TOTAL_REWARDS=50000                # Total rewards to distribute (in ARB tokens)
   START_DATE=2024-09-09T00:00:00     # Program start date in ISO format (UTC)
   PROGRAM_DURATION_WEEKS=30          # Duration of the program in weeks
   
   # Optional
   INFURA_KEY=your_arbitrum_infura_key      # Fallback RPC if ALCHEMY_URL is not set
   PORT=5001                            # Port for the Flask API (defaults to 5000)
   ```

## Usage
1. **Run the application:**
   This starts both the background processing loop and the Flask API.
   ```sh
    python3 run.py
    ```

2. **Access the API:**
   - The Flask API will be available at `http://localhost:<PORT>` (defaulting to `http://localhost:5000`).

## API Endpoints
- `GET /api/get_latest_rewards`
    - Returns the latest calculated rewards and liquidity data.
    - Includes calculation date, program start/end dates, and detailed reward distribution.

## Key Features
- **Time-Weighted Average Liquidity Calculation**: Rewards are based on the weighted average liquidity provided over time.
- **Multi-Protocol Support**: Fetches data from both Curve and Uniswap V3 pools.
- **Proper End Date Handling**: All calculations respect the program's end date (April 7th, 2025).
- **Token Price Integration**: Uses CoinGecko API to fetch current and historical token prices.
- **Resilient RPC Connectivity**: Implements fallback mechanisms and retry logic for blockchain interactions.
- **Comprehensive API**: Provides detailed reward and liquidity data through a REST API.

## MERKL Airdrop Processing

This project includes tools for processing reward data for MERKL airdrops. These tools allow you to:

1. Validate reward calculations
2. Convert rewards to MERKL format for both ARB and T tokens
3. Validate MERKL format files before submission

### Processing Workflow

```bash
# Step 1: Validate the rewards file
python src/utils/rewards_validator.py data/rewards/rewards_20250514_165141.json

# Step 2: Convert rewards to MERKL format
python src/utils/merkl_converter.py data/rewards/rewards_20250514_165141.json --output-dir data/merkl

# Step 3: Validate the MERKL format files
python src/utils/merkl_validator.py --pair data/merkl/rewards_20250514_165141_merkl_arb.json data/merkl/rewards_20250514_165141_merkl_t.json

# Alternative: Process everything at once
python src/utils/merkl_processor.py data/rewards/rewards_20250514_165141.json --output-dir data/merkl
```

For more details on the MERKL processing tools, see [MERKL Tools Documentation](src/utils/README.md).
