# Tiered Loyalty Program Implementation - Completed Task Archive

## Project Overview

**Task:** Implement a tiered loyalty program for liquidity providers using Curve and Uniswap V3 pools on the Arbitrum network

**Completion Date:** May 14, 2025

**Status:** COMPLETED

## Task Description

This task involved implementing a tiered loyalty program that calculates and distributes rewards to liquidity providers based on their contribution to Curve and Uniswap V3 pools on the Arbitrum network. The system fetches blockchain events, processes liquidity data, and calculates time-weighted average liquidity to determine reward distribution.

## Technology Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Web Framework:** Flask 3.0.3
- **Blockchain Interaction:** Web3.py 5.31.0
- **Asynchronous Processing:** asyncio 3.4.3
- **Environment Management:** python-dotenv 0.19.2
- **HTTP Client:** aiohttp
- **Testing:** pytest 7.1.2

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **Event Fetching (`src/blockchain/`):**
   - Implemented fetching of events from Curve and Uniswap V3 pools
   - Created normalization process for different event formats
   - Added error handling and retry mechanisms

2. **Balance Calculation (`src/calculator/`):**
   - Developed daily balance aggregation from event data
   - Implemented time-series tracking of liquidity positions
   - Created data structures for efficient processing

3. **Reward Calculation (`src/calculator/rewards.py`):**
   - Implemented time-weighted average liquidity calculation
   - Created proportional reward distribution algorithm
   - Added support for program start and end date constraints
   - Fixed issue with end date handling to ensure consistent calculations

4. **API Access (`src/app.py`):**
   - Created RESTful endpoints for accessing reward data
   - Implemented response caching for performance
   - Added basic error handling for API requests

### Key Achievements

1. Successfully implemented event fetching from multiple protocols (Curve and Uniswap V3)
2. Created efficient time-weighted average liquidity calculation
3. Implemented reward distribution based on proportional liquidity contribution
4. Fixed critical issue with end date handling to ensure calculations respect program boundaries
5. Improved documentation to accurately reflect the actual implementation

### Technical Challenges Overcome

1. **RPC Provider Reliability:**
   - Implemented fallback mechanisms for RPC providers
   - Added retry logic for handling temporary connection issues

2. **Data Processing Performance:**
   - Optimized event processing for large volumes of data
   - Implemented efficient data structures for calculations

3. **End Date Handling:**
   - Fixed critical issue where calculations used current date instead of program end date
   - Ensured consistent reward calculations regardless of when they're performed

4. **Documentation Alignment:**
   - Created bridge documentation between design proposals and actual implementation
   - Updated memory bank files to accurately reflect implementation status

## Reflection

### Successes

- Successfully implemented core functionality for the tiered loyalty program
- Fixed critical issue with end date handling in reward calculations
- Aligned documentation with actual implementation to improve clarity
- Created a pragmatic implementation that meets all core requirements

### Challenges and Lessons Learned

- Experienced gap between initial design proposals and actual implementation
- Learned the importance of keeping documentation in sync with implementation
- Discovered the critical importance of proper date handling in financial calculations
- Recognized the value of pragmatic implementation choices over theoretical complexity

### Future Improvements

- Consider implementing some of the more advanced features from design proposals
- Add more comprehensive testing for date-dependent calculations
- Explore performance optimizations for larger datasets
- Complete remaining documentation and API enhancements
